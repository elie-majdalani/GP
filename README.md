Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack GP uses:

- The [Node.js runtime environment](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) that runs on the V8 engine is used to run the backend environment.
- The database used is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). This NoSQL database program saves data in a JSON format and is very fast, scalable, and flexible.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a back end web application framework for Node.js. It's a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage servers and routes
- [React.js](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans)is the front-end JavaScript library used for building user interfaces based on UI components.
